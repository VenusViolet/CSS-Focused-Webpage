# CSS-Focused-Webpage
## Description: 
This webpage shows my progress with CSS and how I can use it to design my own webpage from my own code. I utilized week 2's instructions to add HTML code. I then linked it to my CSS sheet. I made sure to organize all semantics correctly. As well as combine the created code in the CSS sheet.
